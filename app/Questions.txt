song player does not get controller in app module?
shouldn't we be consistent?

don't quite get what this means in songPlayer.js
song = song || SongPlayer.currentSong;

song.playing- where's the .playing coming from?
.factory('SongPlayer', ['Fixtures', SongPlayer]);
why is Fixtures in single quotes in songplayer.js
stopSong function where do we use it?
